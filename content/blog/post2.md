Chuck Norris once roundhouse kicked someone so hard that his foot broke the speed of light. Chuck Norris can strangle
you with a cordless phone. Chuck refers to himself in the fourth person. Death once had a near-Chuck-Norris experience.

chicken but Chuck Norris says its beef, then it’s beef. When Chuck Norris gives you the finger, he’s telling you how
many seconds you have left to live. Chuck Norris can have both feet on the ground and kick butt at the same time. Chuck

him.

The Great Wall of China was originally created to keep Chuck Norris out. It didn’t work. Chuck Norris once roundhouse
