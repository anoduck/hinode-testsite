If you have visited this site, then you have already experienced the popup module. It is designed to run as a partial
for the entire website.

## Status

The module was used to display a simple message informing visitors that we are continually adding more and more
information to our site all the time. The result actually caused confusion amongst visitors who misunderstood it as a
message that our site was down for repairs. So, it was immediately removed. 

As a result of the module no longer being used on our site, we have discontinued further development of it.

## Notes

TODO: Include a bit of script to force the popup into showing again.
